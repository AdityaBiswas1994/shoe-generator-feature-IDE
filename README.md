Created a feature diagram for the Converse Shoe Generator using FeatureIDE. Included all crosstree constraints in addition to the feature diagram. We assumed the navigation/filtering bar on the left side of the page as the configurator. Here I assumed that only the categories Gender, Shoe Style, Width, Color, and Material
are important.
